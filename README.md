This is a discord bot ðŸ¤– that I created just for the sake of pranking my friend. 

Commands it support:
--expose : Which exposes all the secrets of my friend
--version : which shows the current version on which the bot is running

You can customise it according to your needs in order to prank your friends âœ¨

Packages you need to install in order to run it on your local machine:
1) pip3 install discord
